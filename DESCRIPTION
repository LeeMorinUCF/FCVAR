Description: Estimation and inference using the Fractionally Cointegrated 
    Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. It includes functions for model specification, 
    including lag selection and cointegration rank selection, as well as a comprehensive
    set of options for hypothesis testing, including tests of hypotheses on the 
    cointegrating relations, the adjustment coefficients and the fractional 
    differencing parameters. 
    An article describing the FCVAR model with examples is available on the Webpage 
    <https://sites.google.com/view/mortennielsen/software>.
